/**
 * @notice The VaultChef is the wrapper of the core `VaultChefCore` logic that contains all non-essential functionality.
 * @notice It is isolated from the core functionality because all this functionality has no impact on the core functionality.
 * @notice This separation should enable third party reviewers to more easily assess the core component of the vaultchef.
 
 * @dev One of the main extensions is the added compatibility of the SushiSwap MasterChef interface, this is done to be compatible with third-party tools:
 * @dev Allocpoints have been made binary to indicate whether a vault is paused or not (1 alloc point means active, 0 means paused).
 * @dev Reward related variables are set to zero (lastRewardBlock, accTokenPerShare).
 * @dev Events are emitted on the lower level for more compatibility with third-party tools.
 * @dev EmergencyWithdraw event has been omitted intentionally since it is functionally identical to a normal withdrawal.
 * @dev There is no concept of receipt tokens on the compatibility layer, all amounts represent underlying tokens.
 *
 * @dev ERC-1155 transfers have been wrapped with nonReentrant to reduce the exploit freedom. Furthermore receipt tokens cannot be sent to the VaultChef as it does not implement the receipt interface.
 * 
 * @dev Furthermore the VaultChef implements IERC20Metadata for etherscan compatibility as it currently uses this metadata to identify ERC-1155 collection metadata.
 *
 * @dev Finally safeguards are added to the addVault function to only allow a strategy to be listed once.
 *
 * @dev For third-party reviewers: The security of this extension can be validated since no internal state is modified on the parent contract.
