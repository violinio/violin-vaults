/**
 * @notice The VaultChef is a vault management contract that manages vaults, their strategies and the share positions of investors in these vaults.
 * @notice Positions are not hardcoded into the contract like traditional staking contracts, instead they are managed as ERC-1155 receipt tokens.
 * @notice This receipt-token mechanism is supposed to simplify zapping and other derivative protocols.
 * @dev The VaultChef contract has the following design principles.
 * @dev 1. Simplicity of Strategies: Strategies should be as simple as possible.
 * @dev 2. Control of Governance: Governance should never be able to steal underlying funds.
 * @dev 3. Auditability: It should be easy for third-party reviewers to assess the safety of the VaultChef.
